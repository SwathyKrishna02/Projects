# Smart Home Automation System (Tinkercad Simulation)

This project simulates a smart home automation system using **Tinkercad**. It includes basic sensors and components to control home appliances like lights and fans.

## 🔧 Features
- 💡 Control lights and fans
- 🚶 Motion detection using PIR sensor
- 🌡️ Monitor temperature and humidity using DHT11
- 📶 Simulated control via Tinkercad dashboard

## 🧰 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- PIR Motion Sensor
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Relay Module
- LED (as light/fan)
- Jumper wires and breadboard

## 🖥️ Platform
- [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/) – for simulation and testing

## 📂 Files
- `Smart_Home_Tinkercad.ino` – Arduino code used in simulation
- `Circuit_Design.png` – image/screenshot of the circuit (optional)
- `Simulation_Link.txt` – contains the link to Tinkercad simulation

## 📌 How It Works
- The PIR sensor detects motion and turns on an LED (simulating a light).
- The DHT11 sensor reads temperature and humidity and displays values in Serial Monitor.
- Relays can be used to simulate switching home devices.

## 🎓 Learning Outcome
- Basics of home automation
- Working with Arduino in Tinkercad
- Using sensors and conditional logic in simulations
